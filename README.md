# Heart_Attack_Risk_Prediction_Analysis
Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dashboard using Tableau

Project Overview :

This is an comprehensive dashboard that focuses on the heart disease risk 
among the youth of India using various demographics ,lifestyles and health
indicators . Its aims to identitfy the trends ,compare heart disease prevalnce,
and provide actionable insights

Top Level KPI used:
Heart Disease Cases: Total cases: 2,038
No Heart Disease Cases: Total: 7,962
Female Heart Disease Cases: 946
Male Heart Disease Cases: 1,048
Average Age of Participants: 26.60 years
Additional KPIs like blood oxygen level, BMI, cholesterol, heart rate, sleep hours, and triglyceride levels offer in-depth health insights.

Insights:

1. Demographic Insights
Urban vs. Rural: 57.21% of heart attack cases are from urban areas, indicating higher risk due to lifestyle factors like stress, diet, and sedentary behavior.
Gender Distribution: More males (1,048) have a heart attack risk compared to females (946) and others (44).
Age Group Risk: The 30-35 age group has the highest heart attack cases (677), followed by 25-30 (556) and 20-25 (577), suggesting a rising trend among young adults.

2. Lifestyle & Health Indicators
Physical Activity:
Sedentary individuals (1,005 cases) have the highest risk, followed by moderate activity (845) and high activity (188).
This shows that a lack of exercise significantly contributes to heart attack risk.

Diet Type:
Non-vegetarians (1,006 cases) and vegetarians (822 cases) have higher risk, while vegans (210) show the least cases.
Suggests that plant-based diets might reduce heart attack risk.

BMI & Heart Attack Risk:
Obese individuals (844 cases) have the highest risk, followed by overweight (418), normal weight (476), and underweight (300).
Weight management is crucial in reducing risk.
Stress Levels:
Medium stress (897 cases) has the highest count, but high-stress individuals (582) also have a significant risk.
Suggests stress as a key contributor to heart attack

3. Medical Factors
Chest Pain Type & Risk:
Typical angina (527 cases) and non-anginal pain (506 cases) contribute to more heart attacks, showing the importance of recognizing chest pain symptoms early.
Cholesterol & Blood Pressure Trends:

Avg cholesterol level among heart attack cases is 200 mg/dL, indicating high cholesterol as a significant risk factor.
Hypertension Stages 1 & 2 have the most cases, confirming the strong link between high blood pressure and heart attack risk.

4. Regional Insights
Heart attack cases are evenly distributed across regions, with the North (353), East (349), and West (349) having slightly higher numbers.
No single region dominates, implying that heart attack risks are influenced more by individual lifestyle factors rather than geography.

Conculsions:
IT can observerd that:
Sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and high cholesterol are major contributors.
#Young adults (25-35) are at increasing risk.
#Managing stress and diet can reduce heart attack likelihood.
#High blood pressure and cholesterol levels strongly correlate with heart attacks.
